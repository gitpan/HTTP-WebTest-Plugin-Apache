This file contains information relevant to the tests that are run
after building the software with "make" and testing with "make test".
Unless you maintain this module you probably don't need to read it.

Please note that cookie tests require your hostname to contain at
least two periods (dots). Otherwise these tests will be skipped.

If test script doesn't detect your hostname correctly you can set it
with environment variable TEST_HOSTNAME.

'apache_max_wait' tests can take long time. It is possible to disable
them by setting environment variable TEST_FAST.

If HTTP::WebTest changes its output then it breaks test suite tests
because they compare HTTP::WebTest output with reference files in
t/test.out directory. Obviously it can be caused by bug in
HTTP::WebTest. In this case that bug should be fixed. However test
suite tests could be broken if HTTP::WebTest changes its output due to
changes in its plugins. The simple way to update all reference files
in t/test.out is setting environment variable TEST_FIX during 'make
test'.

Another useful environment variable is TEST_VERBOSE. If it set then on
'make test' it will be possible to see output from test scripts which
helps debugging a lot. All tests that use reference files in
t/test.out will print difference between reference files and actual
test reports if any.
